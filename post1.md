# Beginning my Tech Refresh

My first blog post and description of my goal with this website.

I've been working in the tech industry for a few years now. In college I focused on software engineering as my previous experience with programming helped greatly in that track.

However, after taking a less technical internship I thought I'd enjoy a career that blended both technical and soft skills.

## Goals for this site
- Share my learning journey
- Document projects
- Write about books, movies, and tech
